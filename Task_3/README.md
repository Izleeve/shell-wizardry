# 🗂️ Automated Backup Solution

## 📜 Overview

To ensure the safety and availability of essential data on **IzleeveTech**'s servers, a well-structured backup system is necessary. This initiative focuses on automating the backup process, compressing data for efficient storage, and implementing a retention policy to manage disk space effectively. The goal is to safeguard critical directories without manual intervention.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

### 1. **Define Backup Scope**:
- Identify directories requiring regular backups. Examples include:
  - `/home`
  - `/etc`
  - `/var/www`

### 2. **Storage Destination**:
- Store backups in a dedicated location such as:
  - `/backup`

### 3. **Compression & Archiving**:
- Utilize `tar` to create compressed archives of the selected directories, optimizing storage efficiency.

### 4. **Automation via Scheduling**:
- Use a cron job to execute the backup script at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

### 5. **Retention Policy**:
- Implement an automated cleanup mechanism to remove backups older than 7 days, preventing unnecessary storage consumption.

### 6. **Completion Alerts**:
- Send an email notification to the system administrator to confirm backup execution and highlight any potential issues.

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

1. **Determine Essential Directories**:
   - Select directories that require frequent backups to ensure data preservation.

2. **Develop the Backup Script**:
   - Create a shell script that compresses and stores backups in the designated location using `tar`.

3. **Schedule Automatic Execution**:
   - Configure a cron job to trigger the script at the preferred frequency.

4. **Integrate Retention Management**:
   - Incorporate logic within the script to delete backups older than 7 days, maintaining optimal disk usage.

5. **Set Up Email Alerts**:
   - Use `sendmail` or `mail` to notify administrators upon successful backup completion.

## 🎊 Summary

This automated backup framework strengthens data protection and ensures quick recovery in case of system failures. With scheduled execution, retention policies, and real-time notifications, **IzleeveTech** can maintain data integrity and prevent loss with minimal manual oversight.
