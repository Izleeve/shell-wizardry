# 🗂️ Backup Strategy Task

## 📜 Task Description

As a system administrator at **MyComp**, you are responsible for ensuring the integrity and safety of critical data on the company’s servers. To safeguard this data, you need to develop a robust backup strategy that includes regular backups of specified directories. These backups should be compressed and stored in a designated backup location, and the process should be automated for seamless execution.

## 🚀 Requirements

### 1. **Directories to Back Up**:
- Specify a list of directories that need to be backed up regularly. Common examples include:
  - `/home`
  - `/etc`
  - `/var/www`

### 2. **Backup Location**:
- Choose a designated location for storing backups, such as:
  - `/backup`

### 3. **Backup Method**:
- Utilize the `tar` command to create compressed archives of the specified directories, ensuring efficient storage.

### 4. **Scheduling**:
- Set up a cron job to automate the backup process, specifying the desired frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).

### 5. **Retention Policy**:
- Implement a retention policy to manage backup storage effectively, such as keeping only the last 7 days of backups to prevent excessive use of disk space.

### 6. **Notification**:
- Send a notification email to the system administrator once the backup is complete, confirming successful execution and providing relevant details.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Directories**:
   - Determine the critical directories that require regular backups.

2. **Create the Backup Script**:
   - Write a shell script that uses the `tar` command to back up the specified directories to the designated backup location.

3. **Set Up Cron Job**:
   - Edit the crontab to schedule the backup script to run at the specified intervals.

4. **Implement Retention Logic**:
   - Include a mechanism in the script to delete backups older than 7 days.

5. **Configure Email Notifications**:
   - Use the `sendmail` or `mail` command to send notifications upon backup completion.

## 🎊 Conclusion

This backup strategy is crucial for safeguarding critical data and ensuring business continuity at **MyComp**. Regular backups, combined with a solid retention policy and notification system, will help maintain data integrity and security.
