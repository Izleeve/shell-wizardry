##📖 Guidelines for the Apprentices

- **Ancient Dependencies**: Ensure that required artifacts (`sendmail`, `firewalld`, `iptables`, etc.) are installed, lest your spells falter.
  
- **Administrator’s Blessing**: Some scripts require root privileges. If the spell demands more power, invoke it with `sudo`.
  
- **Sacred Inputs**: Answer prompts wisely, for the magic within relies on proper invocations.
  
- **Scheduled Rituals**: Use the grand tome of `cron` to schedule these spells for recurring automation.
